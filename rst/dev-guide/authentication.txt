Authentication
---------------

Every REST request against the RackConnect service requires
the inclusion of a specific authentication token, supplied by the
``X-Auth-Token`` HTTP header. You obtain this token by using the
Rackspace Cloud Identity service and supplying a valid username and API
access key.

Identity service for authentication:

Retrieving the authentication token

See the *Rackspace Cloud Identity Guide* for information about how to retrieve the 
authentication token and detailed information about the request and response format and
